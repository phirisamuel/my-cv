##
I work at the intersection of quantum hardware and computation, designing and optimizing integrated systems for trapped-ion quantum processors. My research focuses on building scalable quantum architectures, implementing high-fidelity quantum gates, and leveraging quantum simulation for practical applications. I’m always open to collaborating with researchers at all levels, including those new to quantum computing or research in general. 

I owe my journey in quantum research to a network of mentors, colleagues, and learning opportunities that has shaped my path. 

Beyond my core research, I take an interest in the broader scientific landscape, from metascience to the challenges of scaling quantum technology.
