  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I work at the intersection of quantum hardware and computation, designing and optimizing integrated systems for trapped-ion quantum processors. My research focuses on building scalable quantum architectures, implementing high-fidelity quantum gates, and leveraging quantum simulation for practical applications. I’m always open to collaborating with researchers at all levels, including those new to quantum computing or research in general. 

I owe my journey in quantum research to a network of mentors, colleagues, and learning opportunities that has shaped my path. 

Beyond my core research, I take an interest in the broader scientific landscape, from metascience to the challenges of scaling quantum technology.
