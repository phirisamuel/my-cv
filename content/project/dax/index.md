Real-time control software is fundamental to operating quantum computers, serving as the critical interface between quantum programs and hardware. However, current control software is often optimized for specific systems, limiting flexibility and portability.

In this work, we propose a systematic design strategy for modular real-time quantum control software that enhances efficiency while maintaining adaptability across different quantum platforms. Our approach achieves a 63.3% reduction in execution time overhead for quantum control kernels without increasing binary size. Additionally, our analysis reveals that modular software can share 49.8% to 91.0% of code across two distinct ion-trap quantum systems.

To validate the portability and modularity of our architecture, we implement a portable randomized benchmarking experiment across two different ion-trap quantum systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This work highlights the potential of modular control software in advancing scalable and flexible quantum computing.
